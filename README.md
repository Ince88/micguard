MicGuard uses Android's accessibility service to monitor microphone usage. This allows the app to:
- Detect when apps access the microphone
- Identify which app is using the microphone
- Monitor usage in real-time

### 2. **Usage Stats Permission**
The app uses usage stats to:
- Identify which apps are currently active
- Correlate microphone usage with specific apps
- Provide accurate app identification

### 3. **Notification System**
When microphone usage is detected:
- Instant notification with app name
- Ongoing notification for continuous usage
- Tap notification to open the app

## Installation & Setup
